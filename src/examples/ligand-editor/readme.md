# Ligand Editor Example

Basic small molecule editing features utilizing the `json-cif` format/extension.
This application is (at least currently) not meant to be a production-ready molecule editor.

To run development build locally from the root `molstar` directory (after `npm install`):

```bash
  npm run dev -- -e ligand-editor
```

and navigate to `build/examples/ligand-editor` in the hosted server linked in the script output.
