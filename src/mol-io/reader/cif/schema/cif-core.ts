     * The following rules apply to the construction of the data items
     * _chemical_formula.analytical, *.structural and *.sum. For the
     * data item *.moiety the formula construction is broken up into
     * residues or moieties, i.e. groups of atoms that form a molecular
     * unit or molecular ion. The rules given below apply within each
     * moiety, but different requirements apply to the way that moieties
     * are connected (see _chemical_formula.moiety).
     *
     * 1. Only recognized element symbols may be used.
     *
     * 2. Each element symbol is followed by a 'count' number. A count of
     * '1' may be omitted.
     *
     * 3. A space or parenthesis must separate each cluster of (element
     * symbol + count).
     *
     * 4. Where a group of elements is enclosed in parentheses, the
     * multiplier for the group must follow the closing parentheses.
     * That is, all element and group multipliers are assumed to be
     * printed as subscripted numbers. [An exception to this rule
     * exists for *.moiety formulae where pre- and post-multipliers
     * are permitted for molecular units].
     *
     * 5. Unless the elements are ordered in a manner that corresponds to
     * their chemical structure, as in _chemical_formula.structural,
     * the order of the elements within any group or moiety
     * depends on whether or not carbon is present. If carbon is
     * present, the order should be: C, then H, then the other
     * elements in alphabetical order of their symbol. If carbon is
     * not present, the elements are listed purely in alphabetical order
     * of their symbol. This is the 'Hill' system used by Chemical
     * Abstracts. This ordering is used in _chemical_formula.moiety
     * and _chemical_formula.sum.
