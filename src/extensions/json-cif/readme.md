# JSON CIF Format Support

This extension introduced a JSON encoding of the CIF data format with the goal of making molecule editing more streamlined within the Mol\* ecosystem.

The extensions includes `JSONCifLigandGraph` that enables editing of molecular graphs with `atom_site` and `molstar_bond_site` categories.
