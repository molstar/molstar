# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, following the suggestions of [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/). This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for its most widely used - and defacto - public interfaces.

Note that since we don't clearly distinguish between a public and private interfaces there will be changes in non-major versions that are potentially breaking. If we make breaking changes to less used interfaces we will highlight it in here.
